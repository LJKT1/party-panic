# Party Panic!

_Party Panic!_ is a mini web app built in React just for fun.

The app is designed for politicians being asked awkward questions about lockdown parties.

Ministers can use the app to generate instant responses in real time.

Alternatively, by making use of the in-built buttons, it is possible to prepare and edit an entire speech!

The _Bluster_ button randomly generates individual responses which gradually build into a list.

_Backtrack_ deletes the oldest response.

_U-Turn!_ clears the page.

For fine control over specific responses, there are two further buttons. _Facepalm_ deletes a response and _Thumb up_ repeats a response four times.
